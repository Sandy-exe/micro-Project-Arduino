Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I am Santosh Kumar, student ID 21BCE1829 and a member of a team of five that collaborated on an Arduino project. Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am the sole presenter today. Before proceeding, I would like to express my gratitude to all my team members for their valuable contributions towards the successful completion of this project. Our project aimed to address the issue of energy wastage on highways during low traffic periods, and we believe that our solution will prove to be useful in conserving energy and reducing carbon emissions.

Our project consists of several key components, including the main Arduino board, a breadboard and jumper wires for connections, a 9V battery supply, an IR LED, a receiver LED, 3 300ohm resistors, and a white LED. The IR LED emits IR radiation continuously, while the receiver receives it. When the transfer between the LED and receiver is interpreted, such as when a car or other vehicle is detected on a highway, it triggers the LED to switch on.

As with any project, there are limitations. One potential limitation of our system is its ability to differentiate between different types of vehicles or objects on the highway. Additionally, adverse weather conditions may impact the accuracy of the sensor readings.

Despite these limitations, there are many potential future uses for our project. For example, it could be implemented in smart traffic systems to improve traffic flow and reduce energy waste. It could also be used to monitor parking lot occupancy or to detect intruders in a secure area. We are excited about the possibilities and look forward to exploring these future applications further.
